Another tutorial repository. Enjoy the day, don't crash into a wall(on fire) and keep it up!  

You stopped here! Well, quadloop here studies medtech at KTH. It is a quite broad field of study so quadloop is certain to know something of value for you. Furthermore, although quadloop is unable to quadloop, quadloop can show a thing or two about brackets and difficult entries, if you are nice! Quadloop practices that cool stuff every week for 10 hours.
